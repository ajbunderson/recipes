## Instructions
1. Add water and bouillon to pot. Bring to simmer. Stir well.
2. Poach chicken until cooked, about 20 minutes. Remove chicken and set aside.
3. Add the rest of the ingredients except the bay leaves and zucchini. Bring
back to simmer. Simmer covered until able to stir, about 10-15 minutes. Stir
well.
4. Shred chicken and add back to pot. Stir well. Add bay leaves and zucchini,
and simmer uncovered for another thirty minutes to an hour to let flavors meld.

> Suggestion: Experiment and add whatever keto-friendly vegetables you like.
Add radishes. They turn out like potatoes in soups and roasts. Try celery.
Mushrooms would probably be good too.
