## Ingredients

| Amount   | Ingredient                              |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1 head   | Cauliflower, grated/processed           |
| 2 tbsp   | Unsalted Butter                         |
| 1 tsp    | Salt                                    |
| 1 tsp    | Black Pepper                            |
| 4 cloves | Garlic, minced (Optional)               |
| 1 tbsp   | Sesame Oil (Optional)                   |
| 1 tsp    | Better Than Bouillon Chicken (Optional) |

## Instructions
1. Preheat large skillet, add butter and melt.
2. Add cauliflower, sesame oil, spices, and better than bouillon. Toss and cook
to your liking. I like it pretty crispy, so about 15-20 minutes for me.
3. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes.

> Suggestion: Treat this like any fried rice dish. Go wild. Add all sorts of
ingredients. Scramble two eggs with it. Add peppers and onions. Add scallions.
Add soy sauce. Whatever your heart desires.
